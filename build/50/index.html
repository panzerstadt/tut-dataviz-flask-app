        <div>Imad Sharaf&#39;s body was found the morning of Sunday, May 3, 1992, when firefighters answered a report of a brush fire near the on-ramp to the 405 Freeway at San Fernando Mission Boulevard in Mission Hills. At first, Sharaf, a Granada Hills resident who emigrated from Jordan three years ago, was listed as a riot victim. Detectives now believe that he was drugged before he was set ablaze and that the fire may have been an attempt to make the slaying appear riot-related. Police said that Sharaf, who was a photo lab technician, had been doused with a flammable substance and set afire.</div>

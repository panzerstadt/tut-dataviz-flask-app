        <div>Hector Castro, a 49-year-old Latino, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Koreatown. Castro was shot outside a block of retail shops at Vermont and Leeward avenues by an unknown gunman during a looting melee. The fatal bullet passed through the Central American immigrant&#39;s neck and was never found, authorities said. &#34;There were 150 to 300 people out there,&#34; said LAPD Det. Steven Sena. &#34;Not only were there Korean merchants shooting their weapons to scare off looters, but possible gang members and looters were shooting at the Koreans to get them out of the stores.&#34; &#34;It makes the case almost impossible&#34; to solve, Sena said.</div>

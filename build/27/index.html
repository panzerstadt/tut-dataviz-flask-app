        <div>Betty Jackson, a 56-year-old black woman, died Friday, May 1, 1992, in South Park while rushing to deliver some barbecued chicken to a friend before the citywide evening curfew began. The small car that Jackson and her sister were in was struck by a van at Main and 51st streets. Traffic lights were out throughout the area. &#34;Betty was very generous,&#34; said Ingrid Chamberlin, a relative. &#34;Betty was like the one person you would want to win the lottery. If she&#39;s rich, everybody&#39;s rich. That&#39;s the kind of person she is.&#34;</div>

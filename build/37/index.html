        <div>Arturo C. Miranda, a 23-year-old Latino, was fatally shot Wednesday, April 29, 1992, near the intersection of 120th Street and Central Avenue in Green Meadows. Miranda was riding home from a soccer game with friends when a bullet tore through the vehicle, striking him in the head. His friends rushed him to Memorial Hospital in Gardena, where he was pronounced dead. Miranda had arrived in Los Angeles from Mexico less than a year before and had worked for a textile company. His co-workers raised enough money so his body could be returned to his hometown of Guerrero, Mexico.</div>

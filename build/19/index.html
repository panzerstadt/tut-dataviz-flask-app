        <div>Mark Garcia, a 15-year-old Latino youth, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Lennox. Friends said he was drawn by curiosity to the looting and fires in a mini-mall at Hawthorne Boulevard and 101st Street but did not participate. An initial Sheriff&#39;s Department report alleged that Mark was one of four jewelry shop looters who fled in a black Ford Tempo and engaged in a shootout with Deputies Wayne Beckley and Jeffrey Moore. The suspected looters bailed out of their car six blocks away. Deputies caught up with them in a nearby parking lot and returned fire, killing Mark. The boy turned out to be unarmed. Witnesses, including two youths in the Tempo, have told The Times that Mark had not been in the car with them. Sheriff&#39;s investigators later confirmed that Mark was already at the parking lot when the looting suspects arrived and was shot while fleeing with them from deputies.</div>
